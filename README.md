# de-x-replies.py

**de-x-replies.py** is a Python script designed to delete all of your replies on Twitter without requiring access to the official Twitter API. The script leverages session headers from an authenticated Twitter session to delete only the replies from your tweet history, leaving your original tweets untouched.

## Features

- **Delete Replies Only**: This script identifies and deletes only replies, based on the `in_reply_to_status_id_str` field in Twitter's tweet data.
- **No Twitter API Required**: The script works by using session request headers, so no need for API keys or tokens.
- **Simple and Automated**: Provide the script with a JSON file of your tweet data and a file with request headers, and it will handle the rest.

## How It Works

1. **Input Files**:
   - **Tweet Data (JSON)**: A file that contains your tweet history, typically exported from Twitter or captured via a web session.
   - **Request Headers**: A file containing the session headers captured from your authenticated Twitter session (this can be done via browser developer tools).

2. **Deletion Process**:
   - The script scans the tweet data for replies (identified by the `in_reply_to_status_id_str` field being non-null).
   - For each reply found, the script sends a delete request to Twitter's GraphQL API.

## Usage

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.x** installed on your system.
- **requests** library installed. You can install it using `pip`:
  ```bash
  pip install requests


# de-x.py

**This script can be used to delete the whole history of your tweets, retweets and replies.**

As Elmo restricted access to Twitter's APIs, many tools that did the same job doesn't work anymore, without registering a developer account at X/Twitter.

However, this small script does not depend on those restricted APIs. There is no need to register a developer account nor is it necessary to pay for API access. Only a few manual steps need to be carried out by the user, these steps are explained in detail below.

## Preparation

1. Request an archive of your data at X/Twitter. This archive will be available for download after a few days (mine took like 2 days). If your data is ready for download, you'll receive a notification in your Twitter-App or via E-mail. ![Request Twitter archive at X](doc/archive.png)
2. Once your archive has been downloaded, you need to extract the ZIP-Archive on your disk. You'll need the file called `tweets.js` that is included in the archive. It includes every tweet/reply/retweet including the corresponding tweet-ID.
3. To enable this python script to delete posts with the tweet-IDs from your archive, you must provide session information as well, otherwise the python script will not be able to authorize. The easiest way is to get them from your browser:
   1. Edge/Chrome: Log into X/Twitter as you used to do before. Then open developer tools by pressing `Ctrl-Shift-i`. Now switch to the *Network* tab of the Developer Tools and click on any request to show the headers. ![Copy & Paste session headers at twitter.com](doc/session.png) Just copy and paste every request header after "Accept", including the values that are redacted in this example. It is important to copy the following headers: *Cookie*, *X-Csrf-Token* and *Authorization*. But in doubt, just copy & paste all the request headers to a file on your hard-drive, e. g. `request-headers.txt`.
   2. Firefox: Probably the same as above, PR welcome
   3. burp suite: Just record a twitter-browser session and copy from client request headers.
4. Check that your `request-headers.txt` is formatted correctly. You should remove some newlines that may be there by accident after copy&paste. You can also just copy&paste the values of the following three headers - a minimal request-headers-file could look like this:
```
Authorization: Bearer AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAANR[...]
X-Csrf-Token: b0a38[...]
Cookie: [...] _twitter_sess=BAhD[...]; auth_token=24fa[...]
```

## Run

After you've received your twitter archive and edited a request-header file for a current session (as explained above), we can call our script:

```
de-x.py tweets.js request-headers.txt
```

## Background

If you know the tweet-id, you can delete the corresponding tweet by calling an API with that specific ID, and no rate limiting will be in place. So the first and most important step is to get a list of all tweets (and thus tweet-ids) that shall be deleted. You can do this, using twitter-APIs, but these APIs are restricted and you have to pay for it. Even if you pay for it, there are quite a few limitations and you might not be able to gather a list of all of your tweets.

Thus, it is easier to simply request an archive of all tweets that you have posted so far. This dataset includes all meta-data and, of course, also the tweet-id we are looking for in the first place. You don't have to pay for it, it is complete and machine readable: win.

The archive contains a file called `tweets.js` which is basically a JSON encoded data structure, a list of all of your tweets.

Twitter's `DeleteTweet` API is not restricted, and can be called without registering a developer account at X. Using this approach, you can at least delete around 3000 tweets in roughly 30 min (*).

## Conclusion

There is no *One Click Delete Everything* tool available and it never will. This is due to Twitter's massive restrictions on using their APIs to control your own data. Of course, they would like to keep your data. Forever. However, If you don't want your data being archived at Twitter until global heat finally also kills all machines on planet earth, you should spend some time and effort to delete them - free of charge. Maybe it is possible to build a *One Click Delete Everything* tool using this approach, and maybe it is even user-friendly. I know, the one above is not user friendly, but hopefully this readme is, and hopefully it enables your daughter/neighbor/friend to assist with deleting stuff from the Internet that you don't want to see there anymore. In my opinion, everyone should have the right and the opportunity to delete their own content from the Internet without problems, without barriers and without paying money; regardless of their origin.
